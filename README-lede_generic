Readme for generic LEDE builds

The generic LEDE builds use only the "./src/unum" and "./files" subtrees of 
the repository. The build and install are driven by the package Makefile 
in the LEDE repo, see under "./local-feeds/minim/unum-v2"

All the LEDE builds use the MODEL set to "lede_generic", but pass the 
specific hardware type to make in the "HARDWARE" variable. The type is 
generated by concatenating CONFIG_VERSION_HWREV and CONFIG_VERSION_PRODUCT
variables from the LEDE build config.

The firmware version number is generated by the LEDE build and pulled out
by the agent from the "/etc/openwrt_release" file (DISTRIB_RELEASE var).
The agent has its own version that is generated if it is built separately
from the firmware (only happens during development, it is based on time).
For the release builds the agent version and the firmware version are the
same.
